# My Project

## Description
Its a python program that uses string manipulation and other stuff chariz .. ..  ..
it demonstrates string manipulation, user input, and  conditional statements (if-else).

## Learnings
I learned how similar python and Java actually is and its like coding in broken english (if-else and for loops).
Being used to Java, this assignment troubled me a lot since its my first time coding in a new language but I had fun since I learned
easy and beginner friendly Python is.
The indentation sensitivity is annoying.
